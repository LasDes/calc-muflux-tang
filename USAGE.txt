[1] HOW TO COMPILE

This program is written in C++. Please compile in the following way.

> g++ calc-muflux-tang.cpp -o calc-muflux-tang

[2] HOW TO EXECUTE

This program reads a table of muons' range in standard rock (standardrock.txt).
Please move the execuable in the same directory with standardrock.txt.

> ./calc-muflux-tang 100 0.1
0.000271954

The first argument is the thickness of overburden in the unit of meter w.e.
The second argument is the zenith angle in the unit of radian.
The output of the program is the muon flux after passing through the material 
with a given thickness (standard rock) in the unit of cm^{-2} sec^{-1} steradian^{-1}.
